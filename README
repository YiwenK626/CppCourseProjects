This is the course assignments and projects I've completed for ECE 551 C++ programming in 2020Fall. This cources introduces C/C++ from scratch and covers topics such as Class, Inheritance, Data Structures (Linked List, Graphs, Priority Queues, etc.). The assignments and projects are completed with intensive use of Emacs, GDB, and Valgrind.
